    <p>The classic game of Connect-4 against an AI player. </p>

    </div>
    
    <p>New in this release:</p>

    @DESCRIPTION@

    <p><a href="@URL@">Download Auberon @VERSION@</a> (0.25&nbsp;MB
    disk image). This is a Universal Binary, and should run on Mac OS X
    10.3.9 and later. </p>

    <p>The AI is too strong for its creator at the default level, but
    stronger and weaker settings are available. However, no opening- or
    end-game database is used, so it is doubtful that it will perform
    very well against really strong players. Unlimited undo is at hand
    for those of us who aren't so lucky.</p>
    
    <p>Versions of this game prior to version 0.3 were called "Puck".</p>
